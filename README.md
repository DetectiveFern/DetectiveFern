# 2024 Goals
My main goal for 2024 is to write a full replacement for an old and now stagnant website HypnoDB. This goal will teach me lots about web development and hopefully handling lots of users at once.

My secondary goal is to convert this website replacement into a general metadata website project instead of just being focused on erotic hypnosis and to open source this conversion for anyone to use.
